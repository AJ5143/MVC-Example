# MVC-Example
This is a sample javafx project I developed for learning purposes. 
This project answered so many stackoverflow questions related to TableView, adding Buttons in it, real time updation of TableView according to change in Database etc.
I have used SQLite here. I have followed MVC architecture for development (Which I learned alongside at initial stages of development.)
